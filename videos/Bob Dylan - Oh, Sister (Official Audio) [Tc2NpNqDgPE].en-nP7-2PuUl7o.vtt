00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:38.772
Oh, sister, when I come to
lie in your arms

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.146
You should not treat me
like a stranger

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:54.120
Our Father would not like
the way that you act

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:02.095
And you must realize the danger

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:41.267
Oh, sister, am I not
a brother to you

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:48.675
And one deserving of affection?

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:57.150
And is our purpose not
the same on this earth

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:04.757
To love and follow
his direction?

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:43.963
We grew up together
From the cradle to the grave

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:54.507
We died and were reborn
And then mysteriously saved

00:02:55.375 --> 00:03:01.381
Oh, sister, when I come
to knock on your door

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:08.421
Don't turn away,
you'll create sorrow

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.663
Time is an ocean but
it ends at the shore

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:24.270
You may not see me tomorrow
