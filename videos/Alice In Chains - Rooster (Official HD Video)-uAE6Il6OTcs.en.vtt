- Pop and I never really talked about it.

00:00:06.917 --> 00:00:09.693
The war at all, I asked
him about it one time.

00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:12.661
- You had to survive.

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:14.874
That's the main thing.

00:00:14.874 --> 00:00:17.876
- We were sitting on the
porch drinking beer at night.

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:20.253
In summertime or something
and I asked him a question.

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:21.570
- Sometimes you think,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.520 position:61%
what the hell are we doing here, right?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.710
I've watched my friends die.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.207
- And he just said,
you know, that's death.

00:00:28.207 --> 00:00:29.874
So I just let it be.

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.009
- It's a weird experience,
and a sad experience,

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:42.812
and I just hope nobody
else has to go through it.

00:00:42.812 --> 00:00:43.645
Okay.
