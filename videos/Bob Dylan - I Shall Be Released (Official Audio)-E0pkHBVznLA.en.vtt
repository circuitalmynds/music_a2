00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:14.948
They say every man
must need protection

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:20.587
They say every man must fall

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.429
Yet I swear I see my reflection

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:34.434
Some place so high
above the wall

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:41.674
I see my light come shining

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:47.881
From the west down to the east

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:57.057
Any day now, any day now

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.761
I shall be released

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:40.967
Down here next to me
in this lonely crowd

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:46.806
There's a man who swears
he's not to blame

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:54.247
All day long I hear
him cry so loud

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.086
Calling out that
he's been framed

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:07.360
Yeah, I see my light
come shining

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:13.366
From the west down to the east

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:21.774
Any day now, any day now

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:26.112
I shall be released
